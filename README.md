# Chicago-PD-FOIA
Analysis of the Chicago PD FOIA dataset made available by Invisible Institute. I have rebuilt event IDs from scratch in the use-of-force dataset because the native ones are invalid, linking uses of force that occurred months or years apart. While the use-of-force dataset has been  cleaning and validation of the use-of-force dataset is a novel contribution to the research community.
Supplemented by "Public Safety" data series available at Chicago Open Data Portal.

Goals: Achieve new highs in prediction accuracy of important policing outcomes such as subject use-of-force injury rates and officer misconduct. Develop an Early Warning System that integrates several policing activity categories (arrests, UoF, pedestrian/traffic stops, misconduct investigations) to predict future officer misconduct. Fit a Bayesian hierarchical model that estimates officers' ability to de-escalate dangerous situations. Publish results.

Note: Cleaned and validated use-of-force series will be made available upon publication.
